#+TITLE: gmpl-mode
Major mode for editing GMPL(MathProg) files.

If you are writing GMPL and using GLPK and to solve problems, try this out!

* Overview
  GMPL is a modeling language to create mathematical programming models which
  can be used by [[https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/][GLPK]].

  Although GMPL is a subset of AMPL, the current Emacs major mode for AMPL,
  which can be found at https://github.com/dpo/ampl-mode, doesn't work well with
  GMPL files. Here is the list of the reasons why =gmpl-mode= works better
  compared to =ampl-mode= when editing GMPL files:
  1. Support single quoted string and C style comments.
  2. Some keywords(such as =for=, =end=) are highlighted properly, and it
     provides better hightlighting generally.
  3. A usable indent function.
  4. Some useful commands to interact with =glpsol= directly.

* Usage
** Using the Major Mode
  First, add the =load-path= and load the file:
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/gmpl-mode.el")
  : (require 'gmpl-mode)

  Use =gmpl-mode= when editing files with the =.mod= extension:
  : (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.mod\\'" . gmpl-mode))
** Using =gmpl-glpsol-solve-dwim=
  When in =gmpl-mode=, you can use @@html:<kbd>@@C-c C-c@@html:</kbd>@@ to
  invoke =gmpl-glpsol-solve-dwim=. This command will use the content of the
  current buffer(or the region if the region is active) as the input for the
  =glpsol= command, and then display the results in a separate buffer with some
  colors added. The following command is basically what =gmpl-glpsol-solve-dwim=
  does(Yes, =--ranges= only makes sense for simplex):
  : glpsol -m input-file -o output-file --ranges sensitivity-file

  You can set the variable =gmpl-glpsol-program= to the exact location of your
  =glpsol= command if it is not in the PATH or has some other magic name.

  It is also possible that you can pass extra arguments to =glpsol= command. The
  buffer-local variable, =gmpl-glpsol-extra-args=, controls the value of extra
  arguments. To set extra arguments for =glpsol=, use =M-x
  gmpl-glpsol-set-extra-args= (which is bound to @@html:<kbd>@@C-c
  C-a@@html:</kbd>@@).

  For example, if you want to set the =--interior= option for =glpsol=, you can
  use =M-x gmpl-glpsol-set-extra-args= or @@html:<kbd>@@C-c C-a@@html:</kbd>@@.
  This command will set the value of =gmpl-glpsol-extra-args= and add the
  following lines at the end of the file:
  : # Local Variables:
  : # gmpl-glpsol-extra-args: "--interior"
  : # End:

  After that, when we invoke =gmpl-glpsol-solve-dwim=, essentially following
  command will be used:
  : glpsol -m input-file -o output-file --ranges sensitivity-file --interior

  You can use =gmpl-glpsol-set-extra-args= to set the value of
  =gmpl-glpsol-extra-args= in different buffers so that you can have different
  commnd line arguments for different problems.

* *TODO*
  - Translate LaTeX equations to GMPL format and solve the problem directly.
  - Add company-keywords support.
